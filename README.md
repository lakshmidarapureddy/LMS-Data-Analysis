Program Performance Dashboard: Integrating ERP, LMS & Survey Data
------------------------------------------------------------------
This dashboard transforms raw ERP, LMS, & Feedback Survey data into actionable insights, enabling informed decisions on training effectiveness and resource allocation.

Based on interviews with program managers across Finance, HR, IT, Sales, and Marketing departments, I have designed an intuitive system that addresses the most pressing needs for tracking learner engagement, training effectiveness, and budget utilisation—all in one place.
